# SOLID Principles:

-  [S] Single Responsibility
-  -  The Class Must To Have One Job, And Have One Reason To Change

-  [O] Opened/Closed Principle
-  -  (Classess, Modules, Functions, Etc) Must To Be Opened For Extension, And Closed For Modification

-  [L] Liskov Substitution
-  -  If Class S Is A Subtype Of Class T, Then The Objects Of Type T In The App May Be Replaced With Objects Of Type S, Without Altring Any Of The Desirable Properties Of This App

-  [I] Interface Segregation (ISP)
-  -  ISP Just Working On Interfaces, So We Can't Use It One Javascript, Its Similar To Opened/Closed Principle (Working With Classes And Modules), But ISP Working With Interfaces

-  -  This Pattern Splits Interfaces That Are Very Large Into Smaller And More Specific Ones, So That Clients Will Only Have To Know About The Methods That Thay Are Interested Of Them

-  [D] Dependency Inversion
-  -  High Level Modules Shouldn't Depend On Low Level Modules, Both Must Depend On Abstractions
-  -  Abstractions Shouldn't Depend On Details, Details [Concrete Implementations] Should Depend On Abstractions
